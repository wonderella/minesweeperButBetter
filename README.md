Hello hello hello.
Welcome to my wonderful world of minesweeper.

Here's a general description (the feature list is further down):
Minesweeper with three game modes!
- Normal
    Good 'ol minesweeper, with the thing where if you select a revealed cell
    that has already been correctly flagged, it reveals the rest of the cells
    around it. This is the only game mode with adjustable size and difficulty
    (a percentage of the size of the board).
- Competitve
    Race against a clock instead. You can earn points based on the cells you
    reveal and time remaning on the clock. Hitting a bomb doesn't end the game
    but takes points off and hinders you for a couple seconds. If you don't beat
    the clock, you don't get the points. Use the points to buy more themes! This
    has adjustable difficulties, but size is part of the difficulty.
- Musical
    A hidden gamemode! Like normal minesweeper but notes are added to a song
    based on the number on the cells you reveal, adding notes an interval away
    based on it. Play the song at the end when you win! (I've been obsessed
    with ways you can visualize music, and this is a very cool way!)
- Themes Galore!
    Customize your gameplay! You get three given for free and five to unlock!
    Some are based on me... (joyful noise is my acapella group, tridelta is my
    sorority, meche is my major)


FEATURE LIST:
    - animated button presses
    - themes with a store
    - 3 free themes, 5 to buy
    - three game modes: normal, competitive, musical
    - competitive where you compete against a timer and keep score
        - hindrance mechanic for hitting bomb instead of game over
    - musical where the notes you press correspond to notes, so you can hear
        what your gameplay sounds like
    - gameplay that includes flood fill, chording, flagging, auto-start,
        and clear game win and game over states (competitive mode intentionally 
        doesn't include chording)
    - customizable board sizes and difficulties (normal mode is the only mode
        to pick sizes intentionally) from 8x8 to 15x15
    - updating bomb counter with flagging cells
    - clicking sound effects with mute button
    - smiley face status (as in minesweeper usually: smiley on normal, suspicicious
        when revealing cells, sad when you lose, happy when you win!)
    - special notes for joyful noise and tridelta themes
        - (these themes are based on the clubs I'm in haha)
    - comp mode leaderboard

initally normal mode will be the only mode unlocked
    - unlock competitive by winning normal 5 times
    - unlock musical mode (as it is a secret mode) by clicking the mute/unmute
        button on the menu screen at least 10 times

GRADING SHORTCUTS:

- 'c' will unlock comp mode (this works to both lock and unlock comp mode when you press)
- 'm' will unlock musical mode (this works to both lock and unlock musical mode when you press)
- '0' will add 500 to your total points
- '!' will automatically clear and win the given board (while this will win the board in musical mode
        you will not get a song at the end since it's contigent on you pressing numbers to correspond
        to notes)
        

- also 'f' is to flag and click is to reveal cells.
